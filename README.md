## How to Play
Verdant Shift is a quite basic game, and you'll get the hang of it pretty quickly. Here are some basic instructions:

### 1. Go to the Campaign
In the main game menu, press the "Campaign" button. On the next menu, press "Go".

### 2. Select Your Hero(es) and Press "Go"
Select a hero by clicking/tapping on the display box for the hero. Press "Go" near the bottom of the page.

### 3. Follow Instructions to Attack
Follow instructions at the top of the screen to attack your enemies

### 4. Upgrade Your Heroes and Summon More
After beating the first campaign level, press "Heroes" and use the upgrade level buttons on each hero to increase their levels. Afterwards, press "Back", then "Summoning", and follow the instructions to open a gray shard to summon a new hero.

### 5. Repeat!
That's about all there is. For every campaign level you beat, be sure to read the information on the environmental issue topic of the level.
